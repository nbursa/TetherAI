# TetherAI

TetherAI is a project focused on the development of a modular platform for the integration of different AI providers. The goal is to enable easy use and expandability of AI services through a clearly defined structure and packages. The repo is organized so that it contains basic packages for different providers, as well as usage examples in different environments.

## Structure

- `packages/` - contains different AI providers as separate packages.
- `examples/` - contains demo examples of using the platform in different environments such as Next.js and Node.js.
